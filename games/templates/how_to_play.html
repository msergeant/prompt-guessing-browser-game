        You will be presented with a weird picture that was generated by AI using a prompt.
      </p>
      <p class="pb-8 pt-2 text-xl">
        You will then make a guess as to what prompt was used to generate such a
        picture.
      </p>

      <p class="pt-2 text-xl pb-3">
        An example picture might be:
      </p>
      <img src={% static "img/frogsandwich.png" %} class="h-56 mx-auto w-56"></img>
      <p class="pt-5 text-xl">
        For a prompt like this, you might guess <b>Avocado burger</b> or <b>Stack of veggie burgers</b>.
      </p>
      <p class="pt-2 text-xl">
        The correct answer is of course <b>Frog Sandwich</b>!
      </p>

      <p class="pt-8 text-xl">
        Then you will see every other player's guess as well as the correct prompt.
      </p>
      <p class="pt-2 text-xl">
        You will vote for which prompt you think is correct.
      </p>
      <p class="pt-2 text-xl">
        Each vote for the correct prompt is worth 2 points and each guess that receives a vote is worth 1 point.
      </p>
      <p class="pt-2 text-xl">
        A game consists of 5 rounds of prompt guessing and voting. Whoever has the highest score after 5 rounds is the winner!
